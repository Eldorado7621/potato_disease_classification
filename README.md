# potato_disease_classification
In this project, a CNN model was built to predict if potato is diseased by analysing the picture of the leaf. The uploaded leaf is classified as one of the following "Early Blight", "Late Blight", "Healthy". The end point also gives the confidence level for each prediction.

The model was deployed to Google Cloud Platform and can be tested with postman by using this endpoint- https://us-central1-potato-prediction.cloudfunctions.net/predict

CREDIT- The project is base on tutorial from codebasics
